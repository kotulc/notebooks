# Jupyter Notebooks  

This project includes a sample of notebooks covering scikit-learn, pandas, and plotly.  

## [net_charts](https://github.com/kotulc/notebooks/blob/master/net_charts.ipynb)  

This notebook briefly covers creating some simple stylized charts using pandas and plotly. This was an exercise in working with these two libraries and exploring a few methods for displaying tightly clustered data from a network layer.

## [net_graph](https://github.com/kotulc/notebooks/blob/master/net_graph.ipynb)  

Once I had a better grasp on these two libraries, I attempted to create a graphical representation of each network layer using a plotly graph plot. This notebook is a guided walk through the process of creating and animating this plot.

## [scikit_pipelines](https://github.com/kotulc/notebooks/blob/master/scikit_pipelines.ipynb)  
 
The scikit_pipelines notebook covers the basics of sklearn pipelines using the entry-level Kaggle house data set for illustrative purposes.
